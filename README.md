# Shakespearean Font Recognition

This is an exploratory research problem in font recognition.  You can watch the live stream of development, thinking, and bug writing Tuesdays at 6 PM Eastern.  Streaming and old videos of DanDoesData are all on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/dvbuntu).

A premade dataset is available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0zbVEese408VTR0bXN0dHU1V0U).  It's about 1 GB, so you might want to make your own.

# Progress
