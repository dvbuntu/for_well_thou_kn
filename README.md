# Shakespearean Font Recognition

This is an exploratory research problem in font recognition.  You can watch the live stream of development, thinking, and bug writing Tuesdays at 6 PM Eastern.  Streaming and old videos of DanDoesData are all on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/dvbuntu).

A premade dataset is available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0zbVEese408VTR0bXN0dHU1V0U).  It's about 1 GB, so you might want to make your own.

# Progress

* Create data set, `font_data.h5`
* Read in data, [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VhDjjzvAiE)
* Simple classification model, [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REyDGG9uVbk)
* Simplest possible model with specialty features, [Stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5oGFGCPrtU)
* Reworking dataset to use jittered fonts and remodeling, [Stream1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT-2sj1fYlU) [Stream2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj5tL45b_0s)
* Basic RNN (actually LSTM) [Stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5DBtI8Gm-Q)
